## Device Requirements for Class Activities

Students are required to bring a laptop to class for class activities. Tablets, such as iPads, are not recommendable as they often lack the full functionality and compatibility needed for productivity tasks and software required for this course. A laptop ensures access to the necessary tools and resources for assignments, in-class activities, and collaborative work. Please ensure your laptop is fully charged before class and has the required software installed.

---

## Instructional Strategies & Classroom Policies

This course's learning objectives will be accomplished through lectures and discussions with examples to highlight the material covered. Students will also be given assignments requiring them to apply the studied concepts. Students must study the text and take several tests to assess retention and application. In the active learning approach, students actively explore issues and ideas under the instructor's guidance. Successful active learning does require you to prepare for class every time. You should do the readings, consider the issues, and be prepared to participate in class discussions. As an instructor of this course, my primary role is facilitating learning. There will be lectures in nearly every class period. Still, we will also spend much time discussing ideas, participating in exercises, and practicing the skills necessary to perform well in this class and beyond. Students will receive assessment feedback from the instructor regularly throughout the term. Faculty will keep posted on office hours and will be available for individual student interaction during these hours, in addition to availability through email and discussions, with advanced notice and scheduling.

### Office Hours, Appointments, and Email

My office hours schedule is listed on the first page of the syllabus. Please note that you must schedule an appointment by email before visiting during office hours, as I often have other meetings scheduled during these times. While I maintain regular office hours, I am also available for Zoom meetings at times that better accommodate your schedule. I am committed to supporting your learning and am happy to meet with you.

Please also note that I do not send or respond to emails during weekends, holidays, or vacations. If you email me during these times, I will get back to you as soon as possible on the next business day.

When scheduling a Zoom session, please ensure you can meet the outlined requirements:

- Please schedule meetings only when you can be in an appropriate setting with camera access
- If you anticipate any issues with using your camera, arrange the meeting for a time when this won't be a concern

### Class Updates

I will use the current syllabus or email to post important notes and due dates. Please check your email daily to ensure you have the most up-to-date information.

### Late Policy

You must inform the instructor and request accommodation **before the deadline**. Late assignments will incur a **10% deduction per 24-hour period**. For instance, an individual project worth 100 points will lose 10 points for each day it is late. If submitted five days late, and the assignment is graded at full points, the final score will be 50 points (5 days x 10-point deduction per day = 50-point late penalty).

### Technical problems on your end

You are responsible for keeping your computer up-to-date and fully functional. You are also responsible for maintaining a robust and stable internet connection. Extended due dates will not be granted due to computer or internet failures. Please plan accordingly and finish the assignments ahead of the due date.

### Policy on Final Grades

If you have any concerns about grading or feel that something is unfair, please bring it to my attention immediately. However, discussions aimed at raising your grade from a "C" to a "B" or from a "B" to an "A" will not be entertained. Except for officially awarded OCB points, there will be no opportunities for extra credit in this course.

### Subject-to-Change / Notification Process

I will work hard to stay on that schedule. However, life is unpredictable, so there should be a contingency plan sometimes. Thus, I will reserve the right to change the calendar if necessary. When I need to change the grading component of the course (such as needing to drop a graded activity because of time restraints, etc.), I will get input from the class before doing so. If the dates for the tests need to change, I will notify you during class as early in advance as I can.

## Course Assessment

### Grading Criteria

This course will assess student learning through various activities designed to foster critical thinking in human resource management. Evaluation will focus on meeting writing objectives, clear organization, original thought, and critical analysis. Supporting materials and discussions will aid in achieving success. Grades will be based on the following criteria:

| Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Points                       | %           |

*No final grade will be rounded.*

> **Frequently Asked Questions**
>
> **Q1.** Are OCB points included in the total score?
> **A1.** OCB points are not included in the total score. However, earning these points increases the numerator used to calculate your grade while the denominator remains the same. For example, if the total score for the course is 1,360 and you earn 50 OCB points, your grade will be calculated as (your earned points + OCB points) / 1,360. If you earned 1,200 points, without OCB points, your grade would be 1,200 / 1,360 = 88.24%. With 50 OCB points, your grade would be (1,200 + 50) / 1,360 = 91.91%. This means OCB points directly boost your grade percentage without changing the total possible score.

## Grading Components

### Attendance and Punctuality

To ensure academic success, attendance in the classroom is mandatory, and lectures are designed to supplement the text material with practical application. Approximately 25% of the content covered in class is not available in the textbook. Missing a class can negatively impact your learning and your classmates.

I will take attendance at the beginning of each class session. If you miss the attendance check, you will be marked as tardy. Four tardies equal one absence.

Students are allowed to miss up to 5 classes (20% of total class sessions) without penalty. Starting with the 6th absence, 4 points will be deducted from your final grade for each additional missed class. Students who miss 10 or more class sessions will receive a failing grade for the course.

When students must miss class, it is their responsibility to inform faculty members of the reason for the missed class (documentation may be required) and to arrange to make up any missed assignments, exams, quizzes, and class work, to the extent that this is possible. Excusable absences include, but are not limited to:

- Illness or injury to the student
- Death, injury, or serious illness of an immediate family member
- Religious observances (per the California Education Code section 89320)
- Military or other government obligation
- University sanctioned or approved activities, such as artistic performances, forensics presentations, participation in research conferences, intercollegiate athletic competitions, student government conferences, required class field trips, etc. Extra-curricular activities associated with campus organizations/clubs that are not part of an academic program do not qualify for excused absences.

> **Q1.** Do I need to email you before I miss a class?
> **A1.** No, you do not need to email me or notify me in advance about absences or tardiness. I will track attendance during each class session. However, it is your responsibility to contact a classmate for any missed material or schedule changes. I recommend partnering with a "buddy" and exchanging contact information early in the semester.

### Class Participation

Ask questions. Be curious. You are more than welcome to have a different interpretation of a text than a classmate or me; just be sure to share your perspective in a productive and supportive manner. Since the course will be conducted with discussions and not a series of lectures, the substance of our class will primarily consist of your responses to the course texts (such as general questions) and, secondarily, my engagement with your responses. Your thoughts and questions will provide the starting point for our discussions. Your active participation will be factored into your final grade for the course. If you're reluctant to speak up, please talk to me, and we'll figure out a way for you to participate. Your course grade will be increased by 8 points from the final grade for each class if you participate in class (Up to 80 points).

> **Frequently Asked Questions**
>
> **Q1.** Do I need to participate in every class to get full credit?
> **A1.** You can participate in as many classes as you want, but only up to 10 participation reports will count toward your grade (8 points × 10 = 80 points maximum). However, I keep records of all participation beyond the 10 counted sessions. When students request recommendation letters, I use these participation records to write more detailed and personalized letters.

### Quiz

There will be 14 review quizzes consisting of multiple-choice questions.

### Video and related quiz

There will be 14 videos and related quizzes consisting of true/false or multiple-choice questions.

> **Frequently Asked Questions**
>
> **Q1.** For the chapter review and video quizzes, is there one attempt allowed, or multiple tries, with the best score being taken?
> **A1.** The best score from two attempts will be taken for the chapter review and video quizzes.
>
> **Q2.** How many questions are in the review quizzes and video ones?
> **A2.** Usually, chapter review quizzes will be between 20 and 25 questions, and chapter videos will be two.
>
> **Q3.** Are the quizzes based on the textbook or the lectures/PowerPoints from class?
> **A3.** There are two types of quizzes: (1) a chapter review quiz and (2) a video quiz. The chapter review quiz covers only the textbook. And the video quiz only covers the assigned video.

### Team meetings

On the second day of class, you will receive your role and the list of assigned team members. The team activity will take around 30 minutes and include a Team Meeting Agenda. Team members will record their team meeting activity on the agenda and submit it to Canvas.

> **Frequently Asked Questions**
>
> **Q1.** How many team members are we allowed to have for our team projects?
> **A1.** There will be three to four students assigned to a team.
>
> **Q2.** Do we need to schedule team meetings outside of class?
> **A2.** You will have the team meeting activity in the class.

### Team Presentation

One chapter will be assigned to each team, and the team will give a 25-minute presentation on the assigned chapter's case. For example, the case in Chapter 3 (Hilton Turns to Veterans to Staff the Ranks [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tyKRxmFBTXUmg1OkQznYl0_ttm1_UlwZ/view?usp=sharing)) will be presented by the team assigned to that chapter. Your role is to present as case experts who are intimately familiar with the case and to facilitate class engagement. You should ensure everyone in class understands the case and key learning points. All team members should be involved in the presentation. It is highly recommended that you arrange a meeting with your instructor before the day of your presentation to discuss your plans. See the [Team Presentation Rubric](team-presentation-rubric.html) for more details.

### Exams (Midterm, Final)

There will be four timed exams in the course. There will be two midterm exams and two final exams. The exams will consist of multiple-choice, true/false questions from the text and other course activities. Final Exam II will also include calculation problems where you will need to compute and fill in numerical answers. Your instructor will announce the details of the exams. Your instructor will provide make-up exams for students who cannot test due to illness, family emergency, or military service.

### Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) score

Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) refers to voluntary actions that go beyond formal job requirements but contribute to the overall success of an organization. Research shows that teams with high OCB achieve higher productivity, better collaboration, and stronger performance. In this class, you can earn bonus points by providing constructive feedback on course materials, asking thoughtful questions, helping classmates, or going above and beyond in team activities. **If a team member has helped you in any way, please email the instructor to let them know.** Your recognition helps ensure that helpful behaviors are acknowledged and rewarded.

## Statute of Limitations

Grades will be accessible by password only on MY CSUB (https://my.csub.edu/). For your security, grades will not be provided by phone or email. It is important that each student frequently checks their class grades and immediately notifies the instructor of any discrepancies discovered. After grades are posted, you will have three days to notify the instructor about grading issues or errors. After this period, no corrections or recalculations will be made.

## Instructor Initiated Drop Guidelines for Both Face-to-face & Online Classes

Students on official university business who cannot attend the first day of class due to that business must notify the instructor of record before the first day of class. The student must provide proof of the official university business from the sponsoring program or office to the instructor of record.

Students who are administratively dropped under this policy will be sent an email by the instructor informing them of the drop. Students should not presume they will be dropped by their instructor for non-attendance under this policy. Students who have registered for a class, but never attended, should verify whether or not they are officially enrolled via their "myCSUB" account. It is ultimately the student's responsibility to withdraw officially from the class. It is the responsibility of all wait-listed students (face-to-face and online) to communicate with the instructor concerning readings and assignments that must be completed in the first week of class.

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and certain other federal and state laws, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation in employment, as well as in all education programs and activities operated by the University (both on and off campus), including admissions. The protection against discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation includes sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual exploitation, dating and domestic violence, and stalking. Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth at: https://www.csub.edu/equity-inclusion-compliance/title-ix

**Correct Pronouns, Names, and Inclusion:** I fully support people of all gender expressions and gender identities and encourage students to use the name and set of pronouns that best reflect who they are. In this spirit, I welcome and expect all students to also use the correct names and pronouns of their classmates. I will do my best to respect and use the language you use to refer to yourself and will encourage other members of our classroom community to do the same. Please inform me if my documentation reflects a name or set of pronouns different from what you use and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact me after class, by email, or during office hours.

## Etiquette, & Civil Discourse & Student Conduct

Students in this course are always expected to follow the CSUB Student Code of Conduct. If you are not familiar with the code of conduct, you can learn more about it here: www.csub.edu/osrr/_files/CSUB-Student-Conduct-Code.pdf

In addition, this course requires some specific rules for conduct. Net etiquette or "netiquette" is expected of all students who engage in course forums and discussions. "Netiquette" means that you should treat others with dignity and respect during your team interactions. Here are some "netiquette" rules for your course discussions:

- **Stay on topic & avoid personal attacks.** Respect and appreciate that others may have different perspectives than you. Focus on the topic being discussed and never make a personal attack.
- **Read before you post.** Re-read what you wrote twice before you post it. Is your comment clear, concise, and to the point?
- **Pay attention to your tone.** Remember that sarcasm and some other types of humor can be misinterpreted in written form.
- **Cite your sources.** Cite sources, whether you are quoting directly or paraphrasing.

If you have any concerns about any student conduct during this course, please contact the course instructor.

## Academic Integrity

Certain forms of conduct violate the university's policy of academic integrity and the student conduct code. Academic dishonesty (cheating) is a broad category of actions that use fraud and deception to improve a grade or obtain course credit. Academic dishonesty is not limited to exams alone but arises whenever students attempt to gain an unearned academic advantage. Plagiarism is claiming the published or unpublished work of someone else as your own. This includes handing in someone else's work; turning in copied or purchased compositions; using paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words, or ideas, including paraphrasing, written by another writer; or using data and/or statistics compiled by someone else as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original writer. Plagiarism also includes using your work submitted in another class without the permission of your current instructor.

When a faculty member discovers a violation of the university's policy of academic integrity, the faculty member will meet with the student(s) involved and is required to notify the Dean of Students' office and detail the alleged violation, including the name(s) of the student(s) suspected, the class in which the alleged violation occurred, the circumstances of the alleged violation, and the evidence (including witnesses) supporting the allegation. The faculty member will also formally notify the student(s) suspected of violating the university's policy of academic integrity, the department chair for the course involved in the incident, and the appropriate school dean. The Dean of Students or designee will investigate; confer with the faculty member, student(s), and any witnesses identified; and review all evidence submitted by the faculty member. Students who perform dishonestly in this course may earn zero credit on the assignment/exam or a failing grade in the course, depending on the level of severity of the offense.

Students are expected to uphold the standards of academic integrity. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated and will result in a formal report to the University Dean of Students. You are always expected to follow the student code of conduct.

## Using AI Tools (ChatGPT)

> **Frequently Asked Questions**
>
> **Q1.** How can we avoid plagiarism when using ChatGPT?
> **A1.** You can absolutely use ChatGPT for brainstorming, organizing ideas, or improving the clarity and flow of your writing. However, ChatGPT is not a reliable tool for searching or verifying factual information. This is because ChatGPT sometimes generates information that sounds convincing but is actually false or made up. This is called a *hallucination*. Because of that, I do not recommend using ChatGPT as a source of facts, statistics, or research data. Instead, use academic databases or credible sources (e.g., Google Scholar, library databases, or peer-reviewed articles) to find accurate information. Then, you can use ChatGPT to help you summarize, rephrase, or polish your own writing, but always double-check any content it provides before including it in your work.

## Catalog Statement

The principles of truth and integrity are recognized as fundamental to our campus community. CSUB administrators, faculty, staff, and students are expected to honor and uphold these principles and in so doing protect the integrity of all academic work. A degree at CSUB is a product of our campus's commitment to ethical behavior, academic integrity, and academic excellence. When a violation of academic integrity occurs, it diminishes the value of that degree. Students at CSUB are expected to do all work assigned to them without getting or giving unauthorized assistance. Faculty have the responsibility of planning and supervising academic work so that honest effort is encouraged and positively reinforced.
