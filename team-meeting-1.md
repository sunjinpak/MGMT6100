### [5 minutes] Choose Your Preferred Chapter for Team Presentation

One chapter will be assigned to your team for the team presentation. Your role is to facilitate discussion using the assigned case study, NOT to simply summarize and present the chapter content.

**Important Guidelines:**

- Use the discussion questions provided in the case study

- If those questions seem unlikely to generate good discussion, create your own discussion questions

- Focus only on chapter content directly relevant to discussion facilitation

- Your role is discussion facilitation, not summarizing chapters

**Note:** Check the syllabus to see which chapters have Team Presentations and their dates. Please review your schedules and ensure you do not select chapters for dates when you will be absent.

As a team, rank the chapters with Team Presentation in order of preference:

| Chapter | Topic | Your Rank (1-8) |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Ch 2 | HR Strategy and Planning |  |
| Ch 3 | Equal Employment Opportunity |  |
| Ch 4 | Workforce, Jobs, and Job Analysis |  |
| Ch 6 | Recruiting High-Quality Talent |  |
| Ch 7 | Selecting Human Resources |  |
| Ch 8 | Training Human Resources |  |
| Ch 9 | Talent, Careers, and Development |  |
| Ch 11 | Total Rewards and Compensation |  |

> **Note:** Your team's presentation date will be available in the syllabus by the next class.

### [10 minutes] Team Presentation Expectations

**Your Role as a Presenter:**

- Facilitate discussion based on the assigned case study

- Engage the audience by asking questions (at least one question per slide)

- Share personal experiences to make the content relatable

- Keep the audience involved throughout the presentation

**Key Points:**

- Every team member must actively participate in the presentation

- Meet with your instructor before your presentation date to review your plan

- Focus on discussion facilitation, not summarizing or explaining chapters
