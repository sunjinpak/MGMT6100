## Meeting Agenda

Pair up with a partner. The Notetaker will assign each pair a starting role. In each pair, one person starts as the **Employee Advocate** and the other as the **Employer Advocate**. Roles will swap after each round.

**Tip:** If you had an odd number, the Notetaker pairs with the remaining member.

|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pair 1 |  |  |
| Pair 2 |  |  |
| Pair 3 |  |  |

### [1 minute] Select Today's Topics

Choose **2 topics** from the list below for today's activity.

| # | Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Are labor unions still necessary in today's workplace? | Unions protect workers' rights, ensure fair wages, and address safety | Modern labor laws protect workers; unions may create adversarial relationships |
| 2 | Should companies be allowed to discourage union formation? | Employees have the right to organize without employer interference | Employers have free speech rights to share views on unionization |
| 3 | Should essential workers (healthcare, utilities) be allowed to strike? | All workers deserve the right to strike as a bargaining tool | Strikes by essential workers endanger public health and safety |
| 4 | Should union membership be required in unionized workplaces? | Union dues ensure fair representation for all benefiting workers | Forced membership violates individual freedom of association |
| 5 | Should management be allowed to attend union meetings? | Union meetings should be private spaces for workers | Transparency benefits both parties and builds trust |
| 6 | Should unions have input on company strategic decisions? | Workers are stakeholders who deserve voice in company direction | Strategic decisions should remain management's responsibility |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Round 1 |  |  |
| Round 2 |  |  |
