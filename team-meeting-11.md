### [1 minute] Select Today's Debate Topics

Choose **3 topics** from the list below to debate today.

| # | Debate Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |

|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|

| 1 | Should benefits be flexible (employee choice) or standardized (same for all)? | Flexible benefits allow customization to individual needs | Standardized packages ensure equity and easier administration |

| 2 | Should companies offer unlimited paid time off (PTO)? | Unlimited PTO trusts employees and supports work-life balance | Unlimited PTO may lead to less time taken and unclear expectations |

| 3 | Should employers provide on-site childcare or childcare subsidies? | Childcare benefits support working parents and improve retention | Childcare benefits are costly and may not benefit all employees |

| 4 | Should companies contribute to employee student loan repayment? | Student loan help attracts talent and reduces financial stress | Loan repayment benefits only some employees unfairly |

| 5 | Should wellness programs with health screenings be mandatory? | Mandatory wellness violates privacy and may penalize unhealthy employees | Wellness programs reduce healthcare costs and benefit everyone |

| 6 | Should parental leave be equal for all parents regardless of gender? | Equal leave promotes gender equality and supports all families | Different leave policies may reflect different recovery needs |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |

| ----- | ------- | ----- |

| 1st   |         |       |

| 2nd   |         |       |
