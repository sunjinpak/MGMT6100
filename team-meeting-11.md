## Meeting Agenda

### [1 minute] Pair Up for Today's Activity

Pair up with a partner. The Notetaker will assign each pair a starting role. In each pair, one person starts as the **Employee Advocate** and the other as the **Employer Advocate**. Roles will swap after each round.

**Tip:** If you had an odd number, the Notetaker pairs with the remaining member.

| Pair | Partner A (starts as Employee) | Partner B (starts as Employer) |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pair 1 |  |  |
| Pair 2 |  |  |
| Pair 3 |  |  |

### [1 minute] Select Today's Topics

Choose **2 topics** from the list below for today's activity.

| # | Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should benefits be flexible (employee choice) or standardized (same for all)? | Flexible benefits allow customization to individual needs | Standardized packages ensure equity and easier administration |
| 2 | Should companies offer unlimited paid time off (PTO)? | Unlimited PTO trusts employees and supports work-life balance | Unlimited PTO may lead to less time taken and unclear expectations |
| 3 | Should employers provide on-site childcare or childcare subsidies? | Childcare benefits support working parents and improve retention | Childcare benefits are costly and may not benefit all employees |
| 4 | Should companies contribute to employee student loan repayment? | Student loan help attracts talent and reduces financial stress | Loan repayment benefits only some employees unfairly |
| 5 | Should wellness programs with health screenings be mandatory? | Mandatory wellness violates privacy and may penalize unhealthy employees | Wellness programs reduce healthcare costs and benefit everyone |
| 6 | Should parental leave be equal for all parents regardless of gender? | Equal leave promotes gender equality and supports all families | Different leave policies may reflect different recovery needs |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Round 1 |  |  |
| Round 2 |  |  |

---

### [6 minutes] Individual Brainstorming
