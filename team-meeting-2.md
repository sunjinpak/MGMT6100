### [10 minutes] Review the Team Presentation Rubric

Open the [Team Presentation Rubric](team-presentation-rubric) in the syllabus and review it together as a team. Discuss each evaluation criteria.

**Key sections to review:**

- Preparation (24 points)
- Content and Slide Quality (24 points)
- Presentation (24 points)
- Interaction with the Audience (24 points)
- Discussion Facilitation (24 points)

**Note-taking tip:** Team members share their thoughts freely, and the Notetaker records them below. The Notetaker can also share and write their own thoughts. Keep it brief during the meeting (use short keywords). You can use AI to polish your notes after the meeting.

| Name | What stood out to you from the rubric? |

### [5 minutes] Review the Case Study

Find your assigned case study in the syllabus and open it. You only have 5 minutes, so just quickly skim through the case to get a general idea.

**Discussion Questions:**

| Question | Your Team's Notes |
|----------|-------------------|
| What is the main issue in this case? |  |
| What key concepts from the chapter relate to this case? |  |
| What discussion questions will engage the audience? |  |

> **Important:** The case study includes discussion questions at the end, but they can be difficult for the audience to answer without reading the full case. Prepare debate-style questions that students can answer from employee vs. employer perspectives, even without detailed knowledge of the case. See the Team Presentation Rubric for more guidance.
