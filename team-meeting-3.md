### [1 minute] Select Today's Debate Topics

Choose **3 topics** from the list below to debate today.

| # | Debate Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should companies outsource HR functions to external vendors? | In-house HR better serves employee needs and maintains confidentiality | Outsourcing reduces costs and provides specialized expertise |
| 2 | Should companies prioritize internal promotion over external hiring? | Internal promotion rewards loyalty and boosts morale | External hiring brings fresh perspectives and new skills |
| 3 | Should HR be centralized at headquarters or decentralized to each department? | Decentralized HR is more responsive to employee needs | Centralized HR ensures consistency and efficiency |
| 4 | Should companies use AI/algorithms in hiring decisions? | AI may introduce bias and lacks human judgment | AI increases efficiency and reduces human bias |
| 5 | Should employers have access to employees' social media accounts? | This violates employee privacy and trust | It protects company reputation and ensures cultural fit |
| 6 | Should remote work be the default option for all eligible positions? | Remote work improves work-life balance and reduces commute stress | In-office work enhances collaboration and company culture |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |

| 1st   |         |       |
