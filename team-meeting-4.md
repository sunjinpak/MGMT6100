### [1 minute] Select Today's Debate Topics

Choose **2 topics** from the list below to debate today.

| # | Debate Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should companies implement affirmative action programs to increase diversity? | Affirmative action corrects historical discrimination and creates opportunities | Hiring should be based solely on merit; diversity can be achieved through other means |
| 2 | Should employers be allowed to ask about salary history during hiring? | Salary history perpetuates pay gaps and discrimination | Salary history helps determine fair compensation and budget fit |
| 3 | Should companies set specific diversity quotas for hiring? | Quotas ensure accountability and measurable progress | Quotas may lead to tokenism and undermine merit-based hiring |
| 4 | Should employers conduct background checks on all applicants? | Background checks can unfairly exclude rehabilitated individuals | Background checks protect workplace safety and company reputation |
| 5 | Should religious accommodations in the workplace be unlimited? | Religious freedom is a fundamental right that should be fully protected | Unlimited accommodations may disrupt operations and create unfairness |
| 6 | Should companies be required to provide equal pay transparency? | Transparency helps identify and correct pay discrimination | Salary disclosure may cause workplace tension and privacy concerns |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| 1st   |         |       |
