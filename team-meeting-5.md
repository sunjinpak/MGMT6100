## Meeting Agenda

### [1 minute] Assign Roles for Today's Debate

Divide your team into Employee Advocates and Employer Advocates. The Notetaker will facilitate and record the debate.

**Tip:** If you were on the Employee side last week, switch to the Employer side this week.

> **Note:** If your team has **3 or more members** present, the Notetaker focuses only on facilitating and recording the debate. If only **2 members** are present, the Notetaker must also choose either the Employee or Employer side. In that case, write the Notetaker's name in both the Notetaker row AND their chosen advocate row.

| Role | Name(s) |
|------|---------|
| Employee Advocate(s) |  |
| Employer Advocate(s) |  |
| Notetaker |  |

### [1 minute] Select Today's Debate Topics

Choose **3 topics** from the list below to debate today.

| # | Debate Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should job descriptions be highly detailed or broad and flexible? | Detailed descriptions protect employees from scope creep and ensure fair workload | Flexible descriptions allow adaptation and encourage employee initiative |
| 2 | Should companies rely more on gig workers instead of full-time employees? | Gig work lacks job security, benefits, and career development opportunities | Gig workers provide flexibility, reduce costs, and allow scaling as needed |
| 3 | Should employees be required to work mandatory overtime during busy periods? | Mandatory overtime harms work-life balance and leads to burnout | Overtime is necessary to meet business demands and can benefit employees financially |
| 4 | Should companies implement job rotation programs for all employees? | Job rotation provides skill development and prevents monotony | Job rotation disrupts productivity and may not suit all roles |
| 5 | Should companies allow job sharing arrangements? | Job sharing supports work-life balance and retains valuable employees | Job sharing complicates coordination and may reduce accountability |
| 6 | Should all listed job requirements be strictly enforced during hiring? | Strict requirements may exclude qualified candidates with transferable skills | Requirements ensure candidates can perform essential job functions |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| 1st   |         |       |
| 2nd   |         |       |
| 3rd   |         |       |
