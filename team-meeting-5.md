## Meeting Agenda

### [1 minute] Pair Up for Today's Activity

Pair up with a partner. The Notetaker will assign each pair a starting role. In each pair, one person starts as the **Employee Advocate** and the other as the **Employer Advocate**. Roles will swap after each round.

**Tip:** If you had an odd number, the Notetaker pairs with the remaining member.

| Pair | Partner A (starts as Employee) | Partner B (starts as Employer) |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pair 1 |  |  |
| Pair 2 |  |  |
| Pair 3 |  |  |

### [1 minute] Select Today's Topics

Choose **2 topics** from the list below for today's activity.

| # | Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should companies use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to write job descriptions and conduct job analysis? | AI-generated descriptions may miss nuances of actual work and reduce employee input in defining their roles | AI speeds up the process, reduces bias in language, and ensures consistency across positions |
| 2 | Should job postings drop degree requirements and focus on skills instead? | Skills-based hiring opens doors for qualified candidates without degrees and reduces inequality | Degrees signal discipline and foundational knowledge; removing them makes screening harder |
| 3 | Should salary ranges in job postings be narrow and specific or wide and flexible? | Narrow ranges set clear expectations, reduce pay gaps, and build trust with candidates | Wide ranges give companies room to adjust for experience, skills, and market conditions |
| 4 | Should "culture fit" be used as a criterion in job analysis and hiring? | Culture fit is subjective and can lead to discrimination against diverse candidates | Hiring for culture fit improves teamwork, retention, and overall job satisfaction |
| 5 | Should remote/hybrid work options be a permanent part of every job description? | Flexibility is essential for work-life balance, and excluding it limits the talent pool | Not all roles suit remote work; companies need discretion to adjust arrangements as needed |
| 6 | Should job descriptions be highly detailed or broad and flexible? | Detailed descriptions protect employees from scope creep and ensure fair workload expectations | Flexible descriptions allow adaptation to changing needs and encourage employee initiative |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Round 1 |  |  |
| Round 2 |  |  |
