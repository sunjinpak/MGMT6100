### [1 minute] Select Today's Debate Topics

Choose **3 topics** from the list below to debate today.

| # | Debate Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |

|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|

| 1 | Should employers review job applicants' social media profiles? | Social media review violates privacy and may lead to discrimination | Social media helps assess cultural fit and reveals potential red flags |

| 2 | Should job postings be required to include salary ranges? | Salary transparency helps candidates make informed decisions and reduces pay gaps | Salary disclosure limits negotiation flexibility and may not reflect total compensation |

| 3 | Should companies pay bonuses for employee referrals? | Referral bonuses may create cliques and exclude diverse candidates | Referrals are cost-effective and often produce high-quality hires |

| 4 | Should companies use AI to screen resumes? | AI screening may perpetuate bias and overlook qualified candidates | AI increases efficiency and provides consistent evaluation criteria |

| 5 | Should employers require college degrees for all professional positions? | Degree requirements exclude talented candidates with alternative qualifications | Degrees demonstrate commitment, foundational knowledge, and learning ability |

| 6 | Should companies actively recruit employees from competitors? | Poaching creates industry instability and raises ethical concerns | Recruiting from competitors brings valuable expertise and market knowledge |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |

| ----- | ------- | ----- |

| 1st   |         |       |

| 2nd   |         |       |
