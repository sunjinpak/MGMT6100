## Meeting Agenda

### [1 minute] Pair Up for Today's Activity

Pair up with a partner. The Notetaker will assign each pair a starting role. In each pair, one person starts as the **Employee Advocate** and the other as the **Employer Advocate**. Roles will swap after each round.

**Tip:** If you had an odd number, the Notetaker pairs with the remaining member.

| Pair | Partner A (starts as Employee) | Partner B (starts as Employer) |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pair 1 |  |  |
| Pair 2 |  |  |
| Pair 3 |  |  |

### [1 minute] Select Today's Topics

Choose **2 topics** from the list below for today's activity.

| # | Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should employers review job applicants' social media profiles? | Social media review violates privacy and may lead to discrimination | Social media helps assess cultural fit and reveals potential red flags |
| 2 | Should job postings be required to include salary ranges? | Salary transparency helps candidates make informed decisions and reduces pay gaps | Salary disclosure limits negotiation flexibility and may not reflect total compensation |
| 3 | Should companies pay bonuses for employee referrals? | Referral bonuses may create cliques and exclude diverse candidates | Referrals are cost-effective and often produce high-quality hires |
| 4 | Should companies use AI to screen resumes? | AI screening may perpetuate bias and overlook qualified candidates | AI increases efficiency and provides consistent evaluation criteria |
| 5 | Should employers require college degrees for all professional positions? | Degree requirements exclude talented candidates with alternative qualifications | Degrees demonstrate commitment, foundational knowledge, and learning ability |
| 6 | Should companies actively recruit employees from competitors? | Poaching creates industry instability and raises ethical concerns | Recruiting from competitors brings valuable expertise and market knowledge |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Round 1 |  |  |
| Round 2 |  |  |
