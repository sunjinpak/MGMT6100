## Meeting Agenda

### [1 minute] Pair Up for Today's Activity

Pair up with a partner. The Notetaker will assign each pair a starting role. In each pair, one person starts as the **Employee Advocate** and the other as the **Employer Advocate**. Roles will swap after each round.

**Tip:** If you had an odd number, the Notetaker pairs with the remaining member.

| Pair | Partner A (starts as Employee) | Partner B (starts as Employer) |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pair 1 |  |  |
| Pair 2 |  |  |
| Pair 3 |  |  |

### [1 minute] Select Today's Topics

Choose **2 topics** from the list below for today's activity.

| # | Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should employers use personality tests as part of the hiring process? | Personality tests can be inaccurate and may discriminate against certain individuals | Personality tests predict job fit, reduce turnover, and provide objective data |
| 2 | Should companies use structured interviews or unstructured interviews? | Unstructured interviews allow candidates to show their true personality | Structured interviews ensure fairness and better predict job performance |
| 3 | Should employers conduct credit checks as part of the hiring process? | Credit checks discriminate against people who faced financial hardship | Credit checks may be relevant for positions involving financial responsibility |
| 4 | Should companies require drug testing for all positions? | Drug testing violates privacy and may not reflect job performance | Drug testing ensures workplace safety and reduces liability |
| 5 | Should employers use probationary periods before permanent hiring? | Probationary periods create job insecurity and may be exploited | Probation allows both parties to assess fit before full commitment |
| 6 | Should hiring decisions require approval from multiple interviewers? | Multiple interviewers may slow the process and create conflicting opinions | Panel decisions reduce bias and provide diverse perspectives |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Round 1 |  |  |
| Round 2 |  |  |
