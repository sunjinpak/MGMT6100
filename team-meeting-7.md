## Meeting Agenda

### [1 minute] Assign Roles for Today's Debate

Divide your team into Employee Advocates and Employer Advocates. The Notetaker will facilitate and record the debate.

**Tip:** If you were on the Employee side last week, switch to the Employer side this week.

> **Note:** If your team has **3 or more members** present, the Notetaker focuses only on facilitating and recording the debate. If only **2 members** are present, the Notetaker must also choose either the Employee or Employer side. In that case, write the Notetaker's name in both the Notetaker row AND their chosen advocate row.

| Role | Name(s) |
|------|---------|
| Employee Advocate(s) |  |
| Employer Advocate(s) |  |
| Notetaker |  |

### [1 minute] Select Today's Debate Topics

Choose **3 topics** from the list below to debate today.

| # | Debate Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should employers use personality tests as part of the hiring process? | Personality tests can be inaccurate and may discriminate against certain individuals | Personality tests predict job fit, reduce turnover, and provide objective data |
| 2 | Should companies use structured interviews or unstructured interviews? | Unstructured interviews allow candidates to show their true personality | Structured interviews ensure fairness and better predict job performance |
| 3 | Should employers conduct credit checks as part of the hiring process? | Credit checks discriminate against people who faced financial hardship | Credit checks may be relevant for positions involving financial responsibility |
| 4 | Should companies require drug testing for all positions? | Drug testing violates privacy and may not reflect job performance | Drug testing ensures workplace safety and reduces liability |
| 5 | Should employers use probationary periods before permanent hiring? | Probationary periods create job insecurity and may be exploited | Probation allows both parties to assess fit before full commitment |
| 6 | Should hiring decisions require approval from multiple interviewers? | Multiple interviewers may slow the process and create conflicting opinions | Panel decisions reduce bias and provide diverse perspectives |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| 1st   |         |       |
| 2nd   |         |       |
| 3rd   |         |       |
