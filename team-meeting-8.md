### [1 minute] Select Today's Debate Topics

Choose **3 topics** from the list below to debate today.

| # | Debate Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should employees repay training costs if they leave the company early? | Repayment requirements trap employees and limit career mobility | Repayment agreements protect company investments and ensure commitment |
| 2 | Should training programs be mandatory or voluntary for employees? | Mandatory training takes time from core work and may not be relevant | Mandatory training ensures consistent skill levels across the organization |
| 3 | Should companies invest in training or hire experienced candidates? | Training shows investment in employees and builds loyalty | Hiring experienced candidates provides immediate productivity |
| 4 | Should employees be compensated for training time outside work hours? | Unpaid training exploits employees and violates work-life balance | Training is an investment in employees that benefits their careers |
| 5 | Should companies use online training or in-person training? | In-person training provides better engagement and networking | Online training is cost-effective, flexible, and scalable |
| 6 | Should companies focus training on all employees or high performers only? | All employees deserve development opportunities equally | Focusing on high performers maximizes return on training investment |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
