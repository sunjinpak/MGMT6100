## Meeting Agenda

### [1 minute] Pair Up for Today's Activity

Pair up with a partner. The Notetaker will assign each pair a starting role. In each pair, one person starts as the **Employee Advocate** and the other as the **Employer Advocate**. Roles will swap after each round.

**Tip:** If you had an odd number, the Notetaker pairs with the remaining member.

| Pair | Partner A (starts as Employee) | Partner B (starts as Employer) |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pair 1 |  |  |
| Pair 2 |  |  |
| Pair 3 |  |  |

### [1 minute] Select Today's Topics

Choose **2 topics** from the list below for today's activity.

| # | Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |
|---|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Should companies prioritize internal promotions or external hires for management? | Internal promotion rewards loyalty and utilizes institutional knowledge | External hires bring fresh perspectives and new skills |
| 2 | Should employees have formal career development plans? | Formal plans show company commitment and provide clear growth paths | Formal plans may create unrealistic expectations and limit flexibility |
| 3 | Should companies offer paid sabbaticals to long-term employees? | Sabbaticals prevent burnout and reward loyalty | Sabbaticals disrupt operations and may not provide business value |
| 4 | Should high performers receive significantly more development opportunities? | All employees deserve equal development opportunities | Investing more in high performers maximizes organizational returns |
| 5 | Should companies support employees pursuing degrees unrelated to their job? | Education benefits employee growth regardless of direct job relevance | Company-funded education should align with business needs |
| 6 | Should mentoring be mandatory for all managers? | Mandatory mentoring ensures knowledge transfer and employee development | Forced mentoring may lack authenticity and effectiveness |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Round 1 |  |  |
| Round 2 |  |  |
