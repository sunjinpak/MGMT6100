### [1 minute] Select Today's Debate Topics

Choose **3 topics** from the list below to debate today.

| # | Debate Topic | Employee Perspective | Employer Perspective |

|---|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|

| 1 | Should companies prioritize internal promotions or external hires for management? | Internal promotion rewards loyalty and utilizes institutional knowledge | External hires bring fresh perspectives and new skills |

| 2 | Should employees have formal career development plans? | Formal plans show company commitment and provide clear growth paths | Formal plans may create unrealistic expectations and limit flexibility |

| 3 | Should companies offer paid sabbaticals to long-term employees? | Sabbaticals prevent burnout and reward loyalty | Sabbaticals disrupt operations and may not provide business value |

| 4 | Should high performers receive significantly more development opportunities? | All employees deserve equal development opportunities | Investing more in high performers maximizes organizational returns |

| 5 | Should companies support employees pursuing degrees unrelated to their job? | Education benefits employee growth regardless of direct job relevance | Company-funded education should align with business needs |

| 6 | Should mentoring be mandatory for all managers? | Mandatory mentoring ensures knowledge transfer and employee development | Forced mentoring may lack authenticity and effectiveness |

**Our team's selected topics:**

| Order | Topic # | Topic |

| ----- | ------- | ----- |

| 1st   |         |       |
