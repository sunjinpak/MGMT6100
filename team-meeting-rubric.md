## After the Meeting

### Submission

1. Organize and finalize the meeting notes
2. Submit the completed meeting agenda to Canvas as a Word file
3. Share the document with all team members

**Note:** Any team member may submit the meeting agenda to Canvas, not just the Notetaker. Duplicate submissions are allowed.

### If a Team Member Was Absent

- The absent student will receive the meeting notes from their team
- The absent student must add their own reflections and comments to the document
- Submit to Canvas by the end of that week (Sunday 11:59 PM)

## Self and Peer Review Evaluation

After each team meeting, you will complete a self and peer review evaluation.

**How It Works:**

1. Rate yourself and each team member on the evaluation criteria
2. Provide honest and constructive feedback
3. Submit your evaluation through the online survey (link provided in Canvas)

**Evaluation Guidelines:**

- Be fair and objective in your ratings
- Consider each person's preparation, participation, and contribution to the discussion
- Your individual ratings are confidential and will not be shared with other team members

**Important Policy on Unexcused Absences:**

If a team member was absent and did NOT notify the team in advance, you should give that person the lowest possible score on the peer evaluation. Failing to communicate an absence shows a lack of respect for the team and negatively impacts the team's ability to conduct the meeting effectively.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1. Will our roles be the same each week?**

A1. No. Roles rotate weekly so everyone experiences both Employee and Employer perspectives. At the end of each meeting, discuss and assign roles for the next week.

**Q2. What if I personally disagree with my assigned perspective?**

A2. That's part of the learning experience. Arguing for a position you disagree with helps you understand different viewpoints and strengthens your critical thinking skills.

A3. Redistribute roles among present members. The absent student will receive the meeting notes from the team and must submit their own version with added reflections by Sunday 11:59 PM.

A4. The instructor will provide a debate topic each week related to the course material. Topics may include issues like remote work policies, performance-based pay, employee monitoring, and other HR-related dilemmas.
