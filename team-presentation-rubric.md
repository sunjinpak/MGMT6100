## Sample Presentation Video
Watch this sample presentation from a previous semester to get a sense of the format and style. While your presentation doesn't need to be exactly the same, it will give you a good idea of what to expect.

- [Sample Presentation Video](https://youtu.be/RkT3GnW9DVk?si=CTHoQARLoQGmSny_)

## Overview
Each team will deliver a 25-minute presentation and facilitate a discussion based on the assigned chapter case. As discussion leaders, you are expected to demonstrate a strong understanding of the material and guide the class through the key points. All team members should be actively involved in the presentation and discussion facilitation.

## Objectives

- **Demonstrate Mastery of Course Material**: Show your understanding of the assigned chapter by leading the discussion, explaining key points, and facilitating engaging interactions with the class.
- **Develop Communication Skills**: Strengthen verbal communication, active listening, and the ability to engage an audience.
- **Enhance Critical Thinking**: Analyze and present complex business issues, encouraging classmates to think critically.
- **Encourage Collaboration**: Work with your team to divide roles and coordinate efforts.

## Presentation Structure

This section explains what to include in your presentation and in what order.

| Time       | Activity                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1 minute   | [Introduce yourself](#1.-introduce-yourself-(around-1-minute)\) |
| 30 seconds | [Introduce the objectives](#2.-introduce-the-objectives-(around-30-seconds)\) |
| 8 minutes  | [Summarize the assigned case and lead discussion](#3.-summarize-the-assigned-case-and-lead-the-discussion-(around-8-minutes)\) |
| 5 minutes  | [Show a YouTube video + brief discussion](#4.-show-a-youtube-video-(around-5-minutes)\) |
| 6 minutes  | [Two key points summary](#5.-two-key-points-summary-(around-6-minutes)\) |
| 4 minutes  | [Kahoot quiz](#6.-kahoot-quiz-(around-4-minutes)\) |

### 1. Introduce Yourself (around 1 minute)
Before you start the presentation, each presenter should introduce themselves. Share your:

- Major, minor, concentration
- Years at CSUB
- Activities in student organizations
- Work experiences
- Plans after graduation
- Fun facts about yourself

### 2. Introduce the Objectives (around 30 seconds)
Briefly explain what the presentation will cover and what the audience will learn.

### 3. Summarize the Assigned Case and Lead the Discussion (around 8 minutes)

- First, explain the case study to the class.
- Then, lead a discussion using your prepared questions.
- The audience will discuss using your questions. After the discussion, close by answering your own questions.
- Presenters will earn points based on the number of people involved in the discussion.

> **Important: Creating Discussion Questions**
> - **Do NOT use the discussion questions from the textbook.** Create your own original questions.
> - **Avoid simple yes/no or short-answer questions.** Instead, write questions that encourage debate from both **employee** and **employer** perspectives.
> - **The more classmates participate in the discussion, the higher your score.** Your grade depends on how many people engage with your questions.
> - Good discussion questions spark different viewpoints and make people want to share their opinions!

### 4. Show a YouTube Video (around 5 minutes)

- Show a 5-minute YouTube video related to the chapter.
- Use movie clips, news coverage, or documentaries. Avoid [lecture-style videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2HFusWQIeE).
- Before showing the video, explain why you chose it and how it connects to the chapter.
- After the video, briefly summarize the key takeaways and lead a short discussion about the video content.
- If the video exceeds 5 minutes, [create a link to a specific part of the video](https://www.lifewire.com/link-to-specific-part-of-youtube-video-1616414).

### 5. Two Key Points Summary (around 6 minutes)

- Select **two** key points from the chapter that are directly relevant to the discussion.
- Explain why they are important from your own experiences.

**Example (Employee Engagement)**: "From my experience as a part-time employee during college, I noticed that when my manager took the time to check in with me regularly and showed appreciation for my hard work, I felt more motivated and invested in my job."

> **Tip**: Present without reading from a script. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. They're part of the learning process and can make you more relatable and engaging! The goal isn't perfection. If you aim to avoid mistakes entirely, you might as well just read from a script. Instead, focus on connecting with your audience and presenting your ideas with confidence. Be sure to ask at least one question per slide to keep the class engaged. You've got this!

### 6. Kahoot Quiz (around 4 minutes)
Create five [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) questions based on your presentation. The questions should include:

- Introduction of members (e.g., "Who likes the color green?")
- Key points covered in the presentation
- An explanation of why the presenters think these key points are important
- A case and related discussion topics

Read aloud the Kahoot questions, provide the answers, and explain why some answers may be incorrect.

> **Kahoot Account Information**
> - **ID**: sunjinpak@gmail.com
> - **PW**: shdy!7
>
> Once you have logged in, you will find several games created by other HRM students. Please create a fresh Kahoot Quiz for this session.
>
> **Title format**: Put your team number, chapter number, and section number in the title (e.g., "Ch 5 - Team4 - Section 03")

Keeping the audience motivated can be challenging, but digital tools like Kahoot can help engage students and create a more positive atmosphere. **The winner of Kahoot will receive 1 OCB point.**

## Slide Submission Guidelines

### 1. Create Your Slides

- Create your presentation slides using an online presentation tool such as Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint Online, or other similar services.

### 2. Share Your Slide Link in the Syllabus

- Add your slide link to the Google Document syllabus before your presentation date.
- **Tip**: Create your slides early and add the link to the syllabus right away. Since it's an online document, your team members can start collaborating immediately.
- If you don't know how to add a link in Google Docs, watch this tutorial: [How to Add a Link in Google Docs](https://youtu.be/_cnke4qwY6I?si=xI34R_kPnmoAaVPp&t=57)
- Find your assigned case in the syllabus and add your link next to "(Slide)".
- Example: In the syllabus, you will see `Ch 3 Case, Hilton Turns to Veterans to Staff the Ranks [Link] [Slide]`. Click on the word **"Slide"** and add your presentation link there.
- This saves class time by allowing the instructor to quickly access your presentation.

### 3. Set Sharing Permissions

- **Important**: Set your sharing permissions so that "Anyone with the link" can view the slides.
- If the instructor cannot open your slides during class, it will be considered as not submitted, and points will be deducted.

### 4. Test Your Link

- Open an [incognito/private browser window](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+incognito%2Fprivate+browser+window) and paste your slide link.
- If the slides open without requiring sign-in, your sharing settings are correct.
- If you are prompted to sign in or request access, update your sharing settings.

### 5. Submit to Canvas

- Submit your slide link to the **Team Presentation assignment** on Canvas. This submission is required for the instructor to grade your presentation.
- You can submit early and continue editing your slides. Since it's an online document, any changes you make will be automatically reflected.
- Any team member can submit on behalf of the team.

|                                               | 2   | The presentation should engage the audience by asking simple questions.
